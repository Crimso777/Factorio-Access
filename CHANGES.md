# Version 0.4.0

Updated in September of 2023.

## New Features
- General vehicle support
  * Entering and exiting a vehicle will notify you about the vehicle name.
  * Press K inside a vehicle to learn the heading and coordinates.
  * Pressing L while inside a vehicle will provide additional information about it. For cars, the fuel stocks are stated. For trains, basic info is given while the train menu has detailed info.
  * You can refuel a vehicle by dropping a stack in hand into it via CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET.

- Phases 0 and 1 and 2 of Trains Implementation. In general, we made it accessible to build rail lines, analyze rail segments, build train stations, build and examine trains, and drive trains manually or sub-automatically.
  * Added info support for rails. There is now distinction between end rails, station rails, etc. and the directions of rails are given.
  * Added support for building and renaming train stops.
  * Added train station rail information tool. When you look at a rail behind a train stop, you get information of which section of which rail vehicle would be positioned there when a train stops at the station.
  * Rail appender tool: Adds a straight rail to extend any straight end rail near the cursor.
  * Rail structure building menu: Allows building correctly oriented railway structures based on a selected end rail as the anchor point. Also can add signals to mid rails.
  * Functions added to build 45 degree turns and 90 degree turns as structures at end rails.
  * Added support for building and naming trains.
  * Allowed reading the fuel amount in a locomotive: check its status via RIGHT BRACKET.
  * The contents of cargo wagons and fluid wagons can be checked via RIGHT BRACKET.
  * Information about a train can be read from its menu including name, length, vehicle counts, cargo item counts, etc.
  * Rail analyzer tool: Press J inside a train to learn the nearest structure ahead on the rails and the distance to it. Press SHIFT + J to check the opposite direction.
  * Rail analyzer tool works on foot as well.
  * Subautomatic travel added: You can select an option from the train menu to make a train go by itself to the other station on a rail line with 2 stations.
  * Subautomatic trains announce to any passengers their next station and arriving station.
  * Rail chain signal placement designed to be same as in Vanilla. You need to craft any signals you place and they are refunded when mined.
  * Other additions all across the code to support trains.
  * Note 1: Parallel rail lines should be at least 4 tiles apart. This is partially enforced for the rail appender tool.
  * Note 2: Partially and fully automated train support are goals for later updates. See Chapter 16 of the wiki for more info.

- Rocket silo support added: Silos can now report rocket part counts and launch rockets (press SPACE on it when ready).

- Group mining added: If you press SHIFT + X on a tree or a rail, it will mine all of them immediately around you instead of only one.

- Fixed a bug where entities that have not started using their fuel are reported as out of fuel.
- Fixed various crashes related to reading invalid items.
- Corrected the information error where items cannot be transferred to another building. It is not necessarily because it is full.


# Version 0.3.1

Updated 10/26/2022

## New Features

-Build lock. When enabled, the game will continuously try to build behind the player as they walk, or under the cursor in cursor mode. Useful for tasks like building long transport belts. Press CONTROL + B to enable or disable. It also automatically gets disabled when you switch into or out of cursor mode or empty your hand and take a step.

-Build lock has a special case for small electric poles where it places an electric pole only if it is within 6.5 to 7.5 tiles of the nearest small electric pole, allowing you to build lines of fully spaced out small electric poles while just walking. Note that not every tile between the fully spaced poles is powered.

## Changes

-Scanner Resource Aggregation: On the scan list, patches of resources will now be read as a group.  This includes all resource types including water, trees, and ores.

-Getting item or entity information with the L key now works for entities on the surface and inside chests and most building menus.

-Getting slot coordinates with the K key now works inside chests and most/all building menus.

-In cursor mode, pressing J will announce that the cursor is returned to the player in addition to doing it.

-Transport belt parts such as corners, junctions, and ends will now be specified when read by the cursor.

## Bug fixes

-Fixed a crash when setting filter inserter filters due to being able to select unsupported fluid recipes.

# Version 0.3.0

Updated 9/30/2022

## New Features

-New scanner categorization format.  Scanned entities will now be categorized by what they produce.  You can now tell the difference between a mining drill producing iron, and one producing copper, all from the scan list.

-New Scanner Controls:  Ppress SHIFT+PAGEUP and SHIFT+PAGEDOWN to select a particular building from the scan list.  For example, if you have 3 mining drills, it is now possible to track the one that is 3rd farthest from your position.

-New info: Fluid input and output tiles of buildings will now identify which fluid they should contain. 

-Building status info. Press RIGHT BRACKET with your hand empty when facing a building to read out its status, such as having its output full or missing ingredients. Great for diagnosing problems.

-Chest inventory limiting (bar). Useful for controlling automatically filled chests. When the chest inventory is open, press PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN to increase or decrease the limit by 1. Hold shift while pressing to increase or decrease by 5. Hold CONTROL while pressing to increase or decrease by the maximum amount.

-New inventory transfer shortcut (same as Vanilla Factorio) between building and player inventories. When you have a building inventory open, pressing CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET for a selected item in an inventory will cause an attempt to transfer the entire supply of this item to the other inventory. Non-transferred items will remain in their original inventory. Similarly, pressing CONTROL + RIGHT BRACKET will try to transfer half of the entire supply of the selected item.

-New inventory smart insert shortcut (same as Vanilla Factorio) between building and player inventories. When you have a building inventory open and select an empty slot, pressing CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET will cause an attempt to transfer the full contents of the selected inventory into the other inventory. This is useful for easily filling up labs and assembling machines with everything applicable from your own inventory instead of searching for items individually. Non-transferred items will remain in their original inventory. Similarly, pressing CONTROL + RIGHT BRACKET on an empty slot will try to transfer half of the entire supply of every item.

-New entity info upon encounter: Chests will announce their main contents. Pipes to ground, pumps, and storage tanks will announce the fluids they contain. Accumulators announce their charge percentage and amount. Solar panels announce their current production level based on the time of day. Electric poles announce the current power usage and then the current power generation capacity.

-New info: Transport belt analyzer now announces the position of each lane on the belt segment in front of you. For example, iron plates could be on the south lane of a belt segment facing west. This info is helpful for building sideloading junctions.

-New info: The reserved empty slots for ingredients and products inside assembling machines and chemical plants now announce what is expected to go in them.

## Changes

-Rocks are now categorized as resources because they can contain stone and coal.

-Entity information will no longer state the type of an entity, which usually was a repeat of the entityâ€™s name.

## Bug fixes

-When you open a menu or an inventory, the item in the first slot was not being read. This should be fixed now for all menus.

-Transport belt analyzer now correctly reads contents of upstream belts

## Other

-Thanks to everyone who filled out the player survey!

Pick a direction, navigate the resulting list of options, and confirm a direction with your initial direction key.  For instance, if I wanted to go to the second building north of me, I'd press W to open the northern buildings list, D to select the second building from the list, then W again to confirm.  Press Left Bracket to teleport to your target building.

-Throughput summaries are now provided when looking at a building.  Simply walk up to a belt or pipe, and the mod will tell you what's on/in it.

-Added accessible menu for placing offshore pumps

-Added f to the list of keybinds in the readme


# Version 0.0.2

Updated 6/15/22

-Added tile based descriptions of a buildings input/output.  To see this information, use cursor mode and move around the perimeter of the building.  

   For instance: moving the cursor over the top left corner of a burner mining drill will speak "output 1 north" indicating that things come out of the building, and this occurs 1 tile north of the cursor.

-Added descriptions for direction a building is facing

--Added power output description when cursor is over a generator type building

   note: solar panels are programmed differently, so will require more work for power output information.

   Note, these objects do not yet speak "connected" or "not connected" while placing them, but that too will be added this week.

-Modified building logic to be more reliable.

-Building from cursor now supported.  Player must be in range of the target location, and the target location must be unoccupied

-Removed unnecessary empty inventories from buildings

-Callibration once again has a failsafe.  If your callibration failed, you will be prompted to callibrate again.

-Player will now be notified at the end of every autosave, and at the beginning of any autosave triggered by pressing F1
