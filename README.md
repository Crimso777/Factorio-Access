To install the full version, follow the instructions for .zip install.

Note:  If you have done a full installation using the .zip instructions, there is no need to follow the patch install directions until a new patch comes out.  

Final note: Jaws users should also follow the instructions for installing the .jkm file



# .zip install:

1.  Download "Factorio Access.zip"

6.  If you are a jaws user you may want to do the following:

   an example file path is "C:\Users\Crimso\AppData\Roaming\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\2022\Settings\enu\"


# Patch Install:

# Mod Controls:


## Movement

Movement: W A S D

Note: When you change direction, your character doesn't immediately move a tile in that direction.  Think of it like turning your head before taking a step.

Change movement mode: CONTROL + W

Note the 3 movement types are as follows:

   1- Telestep: Press a direction to turn in that direction, then continue pressing in that direction to move.

   2- Step-By-Walk:  This mode is similar to Telestep, however the player character will physically take steps in the direction chosen.  The biggest difference is footsteps.

   3- Smooth-Walking: In this mode the character will move similarly to in a sighted game. The player will be notified if they run into something, but otherwise will not be notified of entities they are passing. Very fast, and great for getting around!


## Interactions

Mine: X

Open a building's menu: [

Open inventory: E

Place building: [

Rotate: R

Note: If you have something in your hand, you will rotate that.  Otherwise you will rotate the building your cursor is over.

Additional Note: The first time you press the rotate key, it will simply say the direction a building is facing. Subsequent presses will actually rotate the building


## Cursor

Speak cursor coordinates: K

Cursor mode: I

Increase cursor size: CONTROL + I

Decrease cursor size: CONTROL + SHIFT + I

Note: You must be in cursor mode for the size of the cursor to make any difference.

Jump cursor to character: J

Teleport player to cursor: shift T


## Scanning

Scan for nearby entities: END

Navigate scanned entity list: PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN

Change scanned category: CONTROL PAGE UP and CONTROL PAGE DOWN

Change Sorting mode for scanned list: SHIFT + PAGEUP and SHIFT + PAGEDOWN

Repeat scanned entry: HOME

Move cursor to scanned target: CONTROL + HOME

Note: This only works while in cursor mode


## Others

Time of day and current research: T

Save game: F1

Set quickbar #: CONTROL any number

Quickbar: Any number key

Recalibrate: CONTROL + END

Note: If you zoom in and out frequently, you should also recalibrate in order for certain actions like mining and opening buildings to work.


## While in a menu

Note: Many functions are implemented only in the inventory screen, such as shift tab and item information.  Soon these features will be in building menus, but for now it is expected behavior

Change tabs within a menu: tab/shift tab

Select Item: [

Item information: L

Coordinates of current inventory slot: K

Smart Insert/Smart Withdrawal: SHIFT + LEFT BRACKET

Note: This will insert an item stack, or withdraw an item stack from a building. It is smart because it will decide the proper inventory to send the item to.  For instance, smart inserting coal into a furnace will attempt to put it in the fuel category, as opposed to the input category.


### Crafting

Crafting components required: K

Craft 1 item: [

Craft 5 items: ]

Craft as many items as possible:  shift [

Unqueue 1 item:  [

Unqueue 5 items: ]

Unqueue all items:  shift [



## In item selector

Press Left-Bracket or s to select a category.

Press W to jump to previous category level

Press A and d to select a category from the currently selected tier.
