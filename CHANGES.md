#Version 0.3.0

Updated 9/30/2022

## New Features

-New scanner categorization format.  Scanned entities will now be categorized by what they produce.  You can now tell the difference between a mining drill producing iron, and one producing copper, all from the scan list.

-New Scanner Controls:  Ppress SHIFT+PAGEUP and SHIFT+PAGEDOWN to select a particular building from the scan list.  For example, if you have 3 mining drills, it is now possible to track the one that is 3rd farthest from your position.

-New info: Fluid input and output tiles of buildings will now identify which fluid they should contain. 

-Building status info. Press RIGHT BRACKET with your hand empty when facing a building to read out its status, such as having its output full or missing ingredients. Great for diagnosing problems.

-Chest inventory limiting (bar). Useful for controlling automatically filled chests. When the chest inventory is open, press PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN to increase or decrease the limit by 1. Hold shift while pressing to increase or decrease by 5. Hold CONTROL while pressing to increase or decrease by the maximum amount.

-New inventory transfer shortcut (same as Vanilla Factorio) between building and player inventories. When you have a building inventory open, pressing CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET for a selected item in an inventory will cause an attempt to transfer the entire supply of this item to the other inventory. Non-transferred items will remain in their original inventory. Similarly, pressing CONTROL + RIGHT BRACKET will try to transfer half of the entire supply of the selected item.

-New inventory smart insert shortcut (same as Vanilla Factorio) between building and player inventories. When you have a building inventory open and select an empty slot, pressing CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET will cause an attempt to transfer the full contents of the selected inventory into the other inventory. This is useful for easily filling up labs and assembling machines with everything applicable from your own inventory instead of searching for items individually. Non-transferred items will remain in their original inventory. Similarly, pressing CONTROL + RIGHT BRACKET on an empty slot will try to transfer half of the entire supply of every item.

-New entity info upon encounter: Chests will announce their main contents. Pipes to ground, pumps, and storage tanks will announce the fluids they contain. Accumulators announce their charge percentage and amount. Solar panels announce their current production level based on the time of day. Electric poles announce the current power usage and then the current power generation capacity.

-New info: Transport belt analyzer now announces the position of each lane on the belt segment in front of you. For example, iron plates could be on the south lane of a belt segment facing west. This info is helpful for building sideloading junctions.

-New info: The reserved empty slots for ingredients and products inside assembling machines and chemical plants now announce what is expected to go in them.

## Changes

-Rocks are now categorized as resources because they can contain stone and coal.

-Entity information will no longer state the type of an entity, which usually was a repeat of the entityâ€™s name.

## Bug fixes

-When you open a menu or an inventory, the item in the first slot was not being read. This should be fixed now for all menus.

-Transport belt analyzer now correctly reads contents of upstream belts

## Other

-Thanks to everyone who filled out the player survey!



# Version 0.2.0

Updated 07/27/22

New Features

-A new Freeplay map designed by @Sir Fendi, designed to introduce new players to Factorio Access.  Select Compass Valley from the list of difficulties to try it out.

-A new Fast Travel system.  Press V to open the fast travel menu, and save your cursor's location for later.  You are free to name, rename, delete, and create new points whenever you like.

-A new way to navigate your factory: BStride.  Travel from building to building as if they were laid out in a nice even grid.  Press CONTROL + S to open the BStride menu, then navigate with WASD.  Pick a direction, navigate the resulting list of options, and confirm a direction with your initial direction key.  For instance, if I wanted to go to the second building north of me, I'd press W to open the northern buildings list, D to select the second building from the list, then W again to confirm.  Press Left Bracket to teleport to your target building.

-Throughput summaries are now provided when looking at a building.  Simply walk up to a belt or pipe, and the mod will tell you what's on/in it.

-Trying to teleport to a building will no longer give an error.  Now you will teleport to the nearest free position, and the mod will tell you where you are in relation to your target.

-Pressing CONTROL + HOME will now teleport the player to the closest available position near the target, or if in cursor mode the old behavior will still occur.

-Mining a building now has audible feedback

-Copy building settings with SHIFT + RIGHT BRACKET, and paste the settings on another building with SHIFT + LEFT BRACKET.

Thanks again to @Eph for his work in this regard

Updated 6/15/22

-Added accessible menu for placing offshore pumps

-Added f to the list of keybinds in the readme


# Version 0.0.2

Updated 6/15/22

-Started a changelog, version numbers will be reflected here but not in the mods folder just to keep things simple

-Added tile based descriptions of a buildings input/output.  To see this information, use cursor mode and move around the perimeter of the building.  

   For instance: moving the cursor over the top left corner of a burner mining drill will speak "output 1 north" indicating that things come out of the building, and this occurs 1 tile north of the cursor.

-Added descriptions for direction a building is facing

--Added power output description when cursor is over a generator type building

   note: solar panels are programmed differently, so will require more work for power output information.

-Added total network power production to description when cursor is on electric poles

-Added several new categories for scanning

-Empty categories will now be ignored, and the player will not have to move through them.

-Added a Jump to Scanned feature, whereby the player can jump their cursor to the location of something in the scan list.

   This is done with control+home and can only be done while in cursor mode

-Underground belts and pipes are now somewhat accessible.  Once placed they will indicate the location of their connected partner. 

   Note, these objects do not yet speak "connected" or "not connected" while placing them, but that too will be added this week.

-Modified building logic to be more reliable.

-Building from cursor now supported.  Player must be in range of the target location, and the target location must be unoccupied

-Removed unnecessary empty inventories from buildings

-Callibration once again has a failsafe.  If your callibration failed, you will be prompted to callibrate again.

-Player will now be notified at the end of every autosave, and at the beginning of any autosave triggered by pressing F1

   Note: Notifying at the start of game triggered autosaves is a work in progress, and should be done by end of week.

-Fixed crash triggered by selecting "back" option in launcher save file list
