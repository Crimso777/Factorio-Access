## Using the Screen Reader

The screen reader, such as for NVDA, can be used but it is generally not that helpful during gameplay because in-game menus heavily use visual icons and graphs instead of text. We are designing the mod to require the screen reader as little as possible. However, the screen reader is necessary in the following situtaions: When the game crashes, when your character dies, when you win a game, and optionally when you pause the game.
