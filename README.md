#Welcome to Factorio Access!

This is an accessibility mod for the popular game Factorio.  The goal of this mod is to make the game completely accessible to the blind and visually impaired.

To install the full version, follow the instructions for .zip install.
To update to the most recent patch, follow instructions for patch install
Note:  If you have done a full installation using the .zip instructions, there is no need to follow the patch install directions until a new patch comes out.  
Final note: Jaws users should also follow the instructions for installing the .jkm file

#.zip install:
1.  Download "Factorio Access.zip"
2.  Open the .zip file and copy its contents
3.  Navigate to the folder you have factorio installed.  It should already contain a /bin folder, a /data folder etc.  
5.  Paste the files into your factorio folder
6.  That's it!  You are now ready to run launcher.exe in admin mode
7.  If you are a jaws user you may want to do the following:
   Copy Factorio.jkm from the .zip into your JAWS settings folder in your user appdata
   an example file path is "C:\Users\Crimso\AppData\Roaming\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\2022\Settings\enu\"

#Patch Install:
1.  Download control.lua, data.lua, and config.ini 
2.  Navigate to your Factorio folder
3.  Go to mods/FactorioAccess_0.0.1
4.  Paste both control.lua and data.lua in this folder
5.  Navigate back to your factorio folder
6.  Go to the /config folder.  
7. Paste config.ini into this folder
8.  All done!  You can now run launcher.exe in admin mode to play the game with the new patch

#Mod Controls:
Movement:  W A S D
note: When you change direction, your character doesn't immediately move a tile in that direction.  Think of it like turning your head before taking a step.
Change movement mode: CONTROL + W
Note the 3 movement types are as follows:
   1- Telestep: Press a direction to turn in that direction, then continue pressing in that direction to move
   2- Step-By-Walk:  This mode is similar to Telestep, however the player character will physically take steps in the direction chosen.  The biggest difference is footsteps.
   3- Smooth-Walking: In this mode the character will move similarly to in a sighted game.  The player will be notified if they run into something, but otherwise will not be notified of entities they are passing.  Very fast, and great for getting around!
Mine: X
Open a building's menu: [
Open Inventory: E
Speak cursor coordinates: K
Place building: [
Rotate: R
Note: If you have something in your hand, you will rotate that.  Otherwise you will rotate the building your cursor is over.
Additional Note:  The first time you press the rotate key, it will simply say the direction a building is facing.  Subsequent presses will actually rotate the building
Cursor mode: I
Increase cursor size: CONTROL + I
Decrease cursor size: CONTROL + SHIFT + I
note: You must be in cursor mode for the size of the cursor to make any difference

Note: If you zoom in and out frequently, you should also recalibrate in order for certain actions like mining and opening buildings to work

Note: Many functions are implemented only in the inventory screen, such as shift tab and item information.  Soon these features will be in building menus, but for now it is expected behavior

Smart Insert/Smart Withdrawal: SHIFT + LEFT BRACKET
note: This will insert an item stack, or withdraw an item stack from a building.  It is smart because it will decide the proper inventory to send the item to.  For instance, smart inserting coal into a furnace will attempt to put it in the fuel category, as opposed to the input category.
